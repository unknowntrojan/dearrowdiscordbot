This discord bot uses the DeArrow API to de-clickbait YouTube videos sent in discord chats.

## Example

## Usage

Since this was a 2 hour quickie project, it is very simple and not very configurable.

Register a discord application on the discord developer portal.

It requires the following permissions: Attach Files, Embed Links, Read Message History, Send Messages, View Channels.

Get the Bot Token, place it in a file under `src/token`. It will be hardcoded into the binary.
